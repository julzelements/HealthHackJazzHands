Aim
To create an app for a tablet or phone that plays back a subtitle file for a given movie in an easily digestible manner. 

The Problem
There are existing subtitles for just about every film, and when watching a movie at home on a computer, having them displayed is a trivial matter. This iOS app uses voice recognition to identify when a line from a movie is being spoken. It then begins to play the subtitle in correct time.
